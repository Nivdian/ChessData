Welcome to ChessData, a program for fetching playtime from Chess.com (and hopefully also from Lichess in the future). This program can run either as an executable or as a .py file. Do note that Python 3 is required for the .py file so if you do not have Python installed, use the .exe file. Also keep in mind that starting the executable is notably slower than the python file. 

Windows is likley to create warnings for running the executable and if that is a concern to you the python file is the way to go.

I am a beginner in both chess and Python so this program is very scuffed. All tips and critiques are welcome!
