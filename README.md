Welcome to ChessData, a program for fetching playtime from Chess.com (and hopefully also from Lichess in the future). This program can run either as an executable or as a .py file. Do note that Python 3 is required for the .py file so if you do not have Python installed, use the .exe file.

I am a beginner in both chess and Python so the program is very scuffed so all tips and critiques are welcome!
